📘 Slide 1: Title Slide
Project Title: Secure File Renamer Using Python

Name: Surendra Prakash S

Roll No: 722824104245

Institution: Sri Eshwar College of Engineering

Guide: Ms. E. Saranya M.E., (Ph.D)

Batch: 2024 – 2028

🧩 Slide 2: Abstract
Desktop-based application for secure and intelligent file renaming.

Features: batch renaming, pattern recognition, log tracking, and user authentication.

Technologies: Python, Tkinter (GUI), MongoDB (log storage).

Modular architecture for scalability and user-friendliness.

🎯 Slide 3: Objectives
Simplify file renaming with a user-friendly GUI.

Enable batch processing with rules like prefixes/suffixes, regex, and metadata use.

Provide secure logging and history tracking.

Promote consistency and organization in digital file systems.

🌐 Slide 4: Scope
Assists users in managing files using naming patterns and templates.

Stores all actions and preferences securely in a MongoDB database.

Extensible with future features like cloud sync, drag & drop, and real-time logs.

🔍 Slide 5: Problem Description
Manual renaming is error-prone and time-consuming.

No dedicated tools to apply renaming rules and track logs.

Users lack control over large-scale file organization tasks.

Secure File Renamer addresses these issues with a robust Python GUI.
